# UFO Webpage

## Project Overview
### Using JavaScript and HTML, we compiled data in a webpage and added a few parameters to allow filtering in the webpage. At first, the filter component in the webpage would react to a button to respond to the filter. After some reformating, the page was able to filter for the data without the button and would react based user inputs

## Results
### By reformating the code, the page become more elegant and a bit more responsive since it is no longer depending on a button. The first image below shows the raw data in the index.HTML file. The image shows the result of a query after typing a city name "benton" in the city field. To return to the unfiltered page, the user can either erase the name of the city or refresh the page.

## Summary 
### The data used is very limited. All the input/obersevations were from the year 2010. In addition, some of the comments provided no additional value to entry. Adding latitude and longitude of each observation could allow us to plot the observations on a map for more analyis.
